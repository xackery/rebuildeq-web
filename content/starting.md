### Custom Things To Look Out For

### Guild Masters Are Helpful

When you hail a GuildMaster, you'll learn quickly they offer services beyond just training.

- Enchanters, Druids, Shamans, and Clerics will give level appropiate buffs of their respective classes.
- Wizards and Druids can teleport you to their typical destinations.
- Warriors can teleport you to all starter towns.

#### Card Augments

Augments have been simplified and revised! There are now 3 slots for augments: Finger, Weapon, and Chest. 

- Finger augments are clicky effects that can be used for utility.
- Weapon augments are procs or banes, enhancing damage.
- Chest augments are stat modifiers.

As you hunt every creature in Norrath, they can drop cards, so be sure to loot all corpses! You can buy a custom item called a `MonsterDex` on general merchants you would think sell food or water and use it's clicky effect to analyze the cards a monster may drop.
